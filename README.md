Quickly, simply, and asynchronously download NFT's from an Opensea collection.

### NOTICE
This tool is not developed to encourage or facilitate any piracy. It exists to hammer a nail in a board; that NFT's are nothing more than receipts on the blockchain, and that all assets are simply hosted on Google and can easily be downloaded by anyone. It also exists to allow NFT enthusiasts and owners to easily access their own NFT's as well as other NFT's in the collection.
No warez is included in this release and this release utilizes the official OpenSea API (which they can modify to prevent this) to accomplish tasks.
